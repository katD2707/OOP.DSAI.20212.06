----Aims of the project----
* Through this course, we have learned many things, get to know more about the Object oriented Programming.

* Thanks to instruction of Prof. Trang, we understand much clearly about the power of OOP, how an application is built, how the inner of computer works.

* Also, we are not only learn theory, but we also have lab time, that help us to practice what we have learned, based on very clearly guide from Prof.

* And finally, we even make the first application on our own, thanks to OOP, it helps us to organize our class, clean code instead of throwing everything on one class.

* I hope that in the future, we can actually make a product that useful for customer based on knowledge from this course.

* Thank you, Prof. Trang.
